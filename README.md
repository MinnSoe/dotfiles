# dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles which are used to configure my work
environment.

Run `stow ${APP_NAME}` to symlink configuration into its parent directory.
Configuration files with user specific values are stored in files ending with
`.local`, use a copy of the example file as a base for your own.
